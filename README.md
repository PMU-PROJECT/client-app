## TOURISTER

Tourister is the digital version of the booklet of the 100 national tourist sites. Our application aims to help the Bulgarian tourist by providing information about all tourist sites a few clicks away and to digitize the morally outdated system of paper books. With Tourister everything you need is always in your pocket.
